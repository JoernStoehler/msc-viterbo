# Thesis Writing Style Review

**When to use this skill:**
- Reviewing thesis chapters for clarity and style
- Ensuring exposition is appropriate for symplectic geometers
- Checking LaTeX formatting conventions
- Improving readability and organization of mathematical writing

---

## TODO

This skill needs to be fleshed out with actual content about thesis writing standards.

Key topics to potentially cover:
- Audience expectations (symplectic geometers, self-contained exposition)
- How to separate mainline text from asides
- Notation introduction and consistency
- Proof structure and formatting
- Use of headings and signposting
- When to add spoilers/previews
- Handling work-in-progress sections
- Citation and reference style

**Current guidance (from latex-conventions skill):**

### Thesis writing style

- Audience: symplectic geometers; self-contained exposition.
- Separate mainline text from asides.
- Introduce notation once; note deviations from literature.
- Be explicit but skimmable; spoilers up front; headings guide the reader.
- Mark WIP text clearly (e.g., `\edit{}` or `%`).
