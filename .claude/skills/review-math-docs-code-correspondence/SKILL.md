# Math-Docs-Code Correspondence Review

**When to use this skill:**
- Verifying that Rust code correctly implements mathematical formulas from the thesis
- Checking that code comments and documentation match actual implementation
- Ensuring numerical algorithms match their theoretical descriptions
- Reviewing whether code assumptions are documented and justified

---

## TODO

This skill needs to be fleshed out with actual content about how to review correspondence.

Key topics to potentially cover:
- How to trace from thesis formula to code implementation
- Verifying that tolerances match mathematical requirements
- Checking that algorithm invariants are documented and tested
- Ensuring geometric constructions match formal definitions
- When to add mathematical comments vs when code is self-documenting
- How to verify numerical correctness despite Rust's type system limitations (no dependent types)
- Standards for documenting mathematical derivations in code

**Note:** Some content from the former `quality-improvement` skill about mathematical correctness might belong here.
