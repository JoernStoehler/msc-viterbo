# Session Postmortem

Reflect on this session to help improve future agent prompts and workflows.

## Questions

1. **Friction**: What slowed you down or required extra effort?

2. **Unclear instructions**: Were any parts of your prompt confusing or ambiguous?

3. **Missing context**: What information did you need that wasn't provided?

4. **What worked well**: What made this session smooth?

5. **Suggested changes**: Specific improvements to prompts, workflows, or documentation?

Be concrete. "The prompt was unclear" is not useful. "The prompt said 'run tests' but didn't specify which command" is useful.
