## Goals, Non-Goals

- what may one mistakenly think is a goal, but is not?

## Suggested Approach
- what sub-goals, what design ideas, what steps might be taken to achieve the goals?
- why were these approaches suggested instead of others? were they what came first to mind, did they beat alternative approaches, is there a strong argument to expect that any successful outcome would match some aspect of the suggested approach?
- are there alternatives to try if the suggested approach fails?
- what kind of failure modes are anticipated? any notes and considerations already made to mitigate them or to respond to them?

## Measuring Success
