This appendix is a lookup aid, not a full survey. Each entry is a reminder of what to read the cited paper for.

\section{Haim--Kislev 2019 (On the symplectic size of convex polytopes)}
Use when you need the existence of minimum-action closed characteristics that visit each facet at most once, and the subadditivity under hyperplane cuts. It supplies the piecewise-constant velocity model and a finite search space.

\section{Haim--Kislev \& Ostrover 2024 Counterexample}
Primary source for the \(\R^4\) counterexample to Viterbo's conjecture via a Lagrangian product of rotated pentagons. Also provides the concrete 2-bounce orbit and capacity value we use as a regression test.

\section{Rudolf 2022 -- Minkowski Billiard}
Gives the Minkowski billiard characterization of \(\cEHZ(K\times T)\) without smoothness assumptions. Useful as an alternate algorithmic route and for cross-checking product instances.
