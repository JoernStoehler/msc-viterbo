This chapter sets notation and definitions for the rest of the thesis. We follow primarily \cite{CH2021} and secondarily \cite{HK2017,HK2024} in our choice of notation. We assume the reader is already familiar with basic symplectic geometry in a smooth setting (Reeb vector fields, contact forms, symplectic capacities, Hamiltonian dynamics).
