We can homotope \\(\\gamma\\) using mixtures that leave \\(A,B\\) constant, to a path where \\(a(t) = 1_{[0,A]}(t)\\), \\(b(t) = 1_{[A,A+B]}(t)\\). This gives a polygonal path segment. The linearity of the action functional implies: \\(A(\\gamma) = \\int \\tfrac12 \\langle J \\gamma(t), \\dot\\gamma(t) \\rangle dt = + \\int \\tfrac12 \\langle \\gamma(t), a(t) J p_i + b(t) J p_j \\rangle dt\\). However, since \\(J p_i, J p_j\\) are both perpendicular to the 2-face and any possible velocities along it, we have that \\(\\langle \\gamma(t), J p_i \\rangle = \\text{const}\\), and so that \\(A(\\gamma)\\) only depends on \\(\\int a(t) dt\\) and \\(\\int b(t) dt\\), which we kept constant. Thus the action is preserved, and we don't even have to change the interval length.</p> <p>For the 1-face case, may have convex combinations of three or more velocities. Just like before however the action functional is linear and the 1-face is perpendicular to all \\(J p_i\\), so we can again homotope to a polygonal path segment without changing the action.</p> <p>Putting everything together, we get a homotopy of \\(\\gamma\\) to a polygonal orbit \\(\\gamma'\\), along Reeb/Hamiltonian orbits of the same action.</p> <p>Definition (Simple Orbit)</p> <p>A polygonal Hamiltonian/Reeb orbit is simple if every facet velocity \\(p_i\\) is used at most once. Note that breakpoints may still lie in the interior of 2-faces or 1-faces.</p> <p>Theorem (Homotopy to Simple Orbit)</p> <p>Any Hamiltonian/Reeb orbit has a homotopy through Hamiltonian/Reeb orbits to a simple orbit where the action is non-increasing along the homotopy.</p> Proof <p>Omitted. There is a similar theorem with proof in @HaimKislev2017 that uses Clarke's dual principle. It doesn't show a homotopy, only that for any orbit there's a simple orbit with less or equal action.</p> <p>Corollary (Simple Minimum Action Orbit)</p> <p>There is a minimum action Hamiltonian/Reeb orbit that is simple.</p> <p>While we have shown that any minimum action orbit is homotopic to a simple orbit, we have made no statement that all minimum action orbits are homotopic to each other.</p> <p>Example (Viterbo Counterexample Degeneracy)</p> <p>The counterexample to Viterbo's conjecture from @HaimKislev2024 has multiple distinct minimum action closed characteristics, which are all homotopic to each other.</p> <p>See @HaimKislev2024 for details, e.g. Figure 4. The basic idea is that in the two-bounce orbits we can move one bounce point along a pentagon edge while the other stays at a vertex. Then we can switch and move the point that we previously kept still along an edge. This way all two-bounce orbits can be homotoped. Three-bounce orbits can be homotoped into a two-bounce orbit by moving two bounce points that neighbor the same vertex towards the vertex together, until they both reach the vertex at the same time.</p>"},{"location":"02-math/#clarkes-dual-action-principle","title":"Clarke's Dual Action Principle","text":"<p>Fenchel duality yields</p> \\[  g_K(x)^2 = \\sup_y \\big( \\langle x,y\\rangle - \\tfrac14 h_K(y)^2 \\big),\\qquad  \\tfrac14 h_K(y)^2 = \\sup_x \\big( \\langle x,y\\rangle - g_K(x)^2 \\big), \\] <p>with equality iff \\(y\\in\\partial g_K^2(x)\\) iff \\(x\\in\\partial(\\tfrac14 h_K^2)(y)\\).
