**Draft speedup:** Use `includeonly.tex` (copy from `includeonly.tex.example`)

## Math Chapters

Key math definitions live in `chapters/math/`:
- `01-standard-symplectic.tex` - Symplectic space definitions
- `02-convex-polytopes.tex` - Polytope representations
- `05-reeb-dynamics.tex` - Reeb flow and closed orbits
- `08-clarke-dual-action.tex` - Clarke dual action functional

## LaTeX Style

- **Inline math**: `\(...\)` not `$...$`
- **Display math**: `\[...\]` not `$$...$$`
- **Proofs**: Use `proof` environment
- **Labels**: Theorems, lemmas, equations - label consistently
- **Cross-references**: Use `\ref{}` not hardcoded numbers; use `\eqref{}` for equations
- **Custom macros**: Define in preamble, not inline (e.g., `\newcommand{\Sp}{\operatorname{Sp}}`)
- **arXiv-friendly packages only**

## Assets

| Type | Location |
|------|----------|
| Python-generated figures | `assets/<experiment>/` |
| LaTeXML extras | `assets/{html/,latexml/}` |
| Hand-crafted | `assets/manual/` |

## Work-in-Progress Markers

- Use `\edit{...}` or `% TODO: ...` for incomplete sections
- Remove all WIP markers before final submission

## Writing Style

**Audience:**
- Thesis readers: MSc math students who took a symplectic geometry lecture
- Code developers: Claude agents with broad knowledge of symplectic geometry, optimization, algorithms
- Project owner: Jörn, up to speed with thesis references

**Goals:** Self-contained, skimmable, spoilers up front.

**Conventions:**
- State main results before proofs
- Define notation when first used; note deviations from literature
- Roadmap long proofs with "Proof strategy" paragraph
