# Maintain Environment (Extended Reference)
- We have a single reproducible development environment; it is fully specified in `.devcontainer/{Dockerfile,devcontainer.json}`, `scripts/devcontainer-post-create.sh`, `msc-viterbo.code-workspace`.
- Environment changes must be approved by the project owner and require a devcontainer rebuild. We directly modify the definition files instead of ad-hoc local installs to ensure reproducibility and documentation.
- Available tools:
  - Base image: `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu`
  - Rust, Python+uv, Node+npm, TeX Live + latexml
  - Common CLIs: `git, gh, rg, jq, fd, curl, tree, inotifywait, entr`
  - IDE for Project Owner: `code-tunnel`
- Host binds: see `devcontainer.json`. Host dirs must be created or the rebuild will fail. Host binds persist caches and oauth tokens and configs across rebuilds.
- Worktrees: persisted in `/workspaces/worktrees/`
- Shared across worktrees: host binds, and `/workspaces/worktrees/shared/`:
  - Rust `target/` dir for faster builds
- Toolchain usage is mentioned in the packages' docs.
- All agents and the project owner always use the same devcontainer on the same ubuntu 24.04 host OS. No other clones of the repo exist, so gitignored changes and caches are available to future agents unless manually deleted e.g. as part of a worktree removal.
