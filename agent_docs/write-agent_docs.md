# Writing Agent Docs
- Agents start without any memory or knowledge about the project. We provide onboarding and reference materials in `AGENTS.md`, `agent_docs/`, and `packages/*/AGENTS.md`, `packages/*/agent_docs/`. This is in addition to the normal repo contents.
- Main purpose is to tell agents about meta knowledge that is not explicit in the normal repo contents, e.g. code style conventions, and leave breadcrumbs to speed up the agents' onboarding phase by helping them triage what to read and what commands to run.
- Instruction count: we minimize the number of simultaneously explicit instructions that agents have to pay attention to. Studies show agents' performance degrades if they have to focus on 50 instructions at once. Tactics:
  - Grouping: we group instructions and facts that are useful for similar tasks together. We split knowledge that's not frequently needed together into separate files. This way agents can triage what to read based on their current task.
  - Default behavior: we don't write instructions unless we must change the agents' behavior. Their default behavior follows many best practices already, and superfluous instructions just waste our tight instruction budget.
  - Clarity: we write instructions in a clear, literally correct, actionable way to get the best out of our limited instruction budget.
  - Popular: we pick specific, professional, popular conventions, workflows, tools, patterns, terminology. Agents are familiar with these from training, need no further explanations, and know how to apply them without paying high attention. This reduces the impact on our instruction budget, though there always is some cost.
- Readability: agents read files in chunks of <=250 lines and <=10kB, so we stay below these limits per file.
- Naming: we use expressive, conventional names for files, to help agents triage what to skip based on filenames alone.
- Approval: any edits to the onboarding and reference materials must be reviewed and accepted by the project owner. Use <!-- comments --> to add inline commentary to explain edits.
