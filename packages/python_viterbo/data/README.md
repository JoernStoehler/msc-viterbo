# Data layout (polytopes and experiment inputs)

This directory will hold polytope datasets generated by `viterbo.dataset`.

Conventions:
- Store machine-readable facet data as JSON or Parquet.
- Assets produced from these datasets should be written under `packages/latex_viterbo/assets/<category>/`.
