# Decisions (Clarke Duality Talk)

Keep this file low-friction. Add new entries at the top of each section.

## Approved decisions
- 2026-01-08 - Decision: Treat all talk content as unapproved until marked. Be very explicit and unambiguous about what is approved and unapproved in general.
- 2026-01-08 - Audience level: the audience on Monday will be PhD students, Profs, Post-Docs of the group, who are all familiar with basic Symplectic Geometry and then branched out into their specialized fields. It is useful to very briefly restate e.g. standard notation of symplectic geometry on R^4, but at least I do not need to explain what properties a symplectic form has. Since there are different related concepts (Reeb orbits, Hamiltonian orbits, closed characteristics) it is useful to define them again *on a high level*, and highlight that closed characteristics are unparameterized. The audience is interested in hearing about what everyone in the university group is doing, so I can hook them with the research question.
- 2026-01-08 - Target duration (minutes): 90min, but that includes a break and questions.
- 2026-01-08 - Slide budget (# frames): if I aim for 60min of talking, that's probably 40 slides roughly.
- 2026-01-08 - Citations on slides vs. spoken: My usual style is to briefly point out what is original research and what is from the literature; for this talk, we mainly have ~3 sources, so I can briefly have a slide at the start + bibliography slide at the end + citations beneath figures/etc that are taken from the literature.
- 2026-01-08 - Talk date: next Monday = 2026-01-12.
- 2026-01-08 - Freeze tag + archive PDF date: Uh, well, I will give the talk on Monday (2026-01-12), might fix some stuff I learn about during/after the talk, so we can freeze on Tuesday (2026-01-13).
- 2026-01-08 - Talk format: slides-only; chalk only for addressing questions.
- 2026-01-08 - Focus: not the full project; the main focus is "we have a problem that's constrained to some class of curves, and we want to show some property on the minimizers, and we use Clarke's Duality Principle to switch to a problem that's differently constrained, in a way where we can then show the property on the minimizers, and that property transfers back to the original problem."
- 2026-01-08 - Q&A: interleaved questions + post-discussion.
- 2026-01-08 - Break: roughly in the middle of the 90min.
- 2026-01-08 - Approval rule: Only explicitly approved items are approved. No implicit approval from silence, partial answers, or unanswered questions.

## Open questions (no approved answer yet)
- Figures final vs. redraw: I will probably draw figures by hand -- unsure yet how to get them into this repo! Maybe I screenshot on my tablet, my chromebook, or from my wacom pen thingy with xournal++ (?).
