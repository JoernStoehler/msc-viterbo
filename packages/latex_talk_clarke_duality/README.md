# Clarke Duality Talk (ephemeral)

This package is intentionally short-lived.

If this package is deleted from `main`, find the frozen source state via the git tag:
- `talk-clarke-duality-YYYY-MM-DD`

After the talk, follow `CHECKLIST_TEARDOWN.md`.

## Commands
- Build: `./scripts/build.sh`
- Watch (latexmk): `latexmk -pvc -pdf -output-directory=build main.tex`

## Notes on assets
- Put hand-drawn sketches under `assets/manual/`.
- Prefer PDF exports (vector) over PNG when possible.
