summary: Definitions and results needed up to the custom algorithm.
---

This chapter fixes notation and the minimal symplectic/convex background used later.  It is Lean-friendly but informal; proofs are omitted or sketched with references.  Sections:

1. Symplectic preliminaries in dimension 4
2. Convex bodies and polytopes
3. Closed characteristics and Hamiltonian orbits on polytopes
4. Action functional and EHZ capacity
5. Fenchel duality and Clarke’s functional
6. Combinatorial model on polytopes (HK formula)
7. Rotation numbers and Conley–Zehnder bounds
8. Examples (polydisk sketch, HK2024 counterexample)
