title: Reviews Index
---

Status: Implemented (scope: reviews index and conventions; caveats: requires manual updates when topics evolve)

# Reviews — Index and Conventions

Purpose
- Central index for all repository reviews. Each review focuses on a single topic to produce a long, unfiltered, unsorted list of findings. Results feed into consolidation and planning.

How to add a review
- Use the template: `docs/reviews/TEMPLATE.md` (copy and fill the placeholders).
- Create: `docs/reviews/XX-<stub>.md` where `XX` is a zero‑padded topic number.
- Content: be thorough; unsorted is fine; redundancy OK. Use clear, specific language. No length limit.
- Deliverable path: keep the file under `docs/reviews/` so it publishes and is easy to reference.
- Cross‑link: add a single bullet link here after saving the file.

Pre‑Submit Checklist (per review)
- Linked from this index under Published reviews
- `uv run mkdocs build --strict` green
- `just checks` green (or N/A for docs‑only changes)
- Actions extracted (even minimal is fine)
- Cross‑refs noted (topics/files)
- Provenance filled (Topic, Author, Date, Commit, Timebox, Scope, Version)
- Title follows `Review XX — <Topic Title>`
