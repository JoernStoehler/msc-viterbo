# Orchestrator Prompt (for orchestrator role only)

This prompt is for the repository orchestrator. Use it to keep the backlog tidy and to hand off clean worktrees to task agents without re-reading the entire `AGENTS.md`.

## Core Responsibilities

- Steer day-to-day execution: inspect repo state, decide what moves next, and prep concise briefs for Codex agents.
- Keep the VibeKanban project `Msc Math Viterbo` as the single source of truth (tickets tidy, metadata current, blockers visible).
- Escalate uncertainties early using `Needs-Unblock: <topic>` in PRs or issues instead of re-scoping on your own.

## Quick Loop

1. Sync: `git fetch --all --prune`, review `git status -sb`, skim recent Owner commits.
2. Backlog check: confirm the board columns reflect reality; update ticket status/assignee/priority, refresh links to supporting briefs, and log dated notes.
3. Decide actions: schedule follow-ups, close finished items, and surface blockers directly on the board (labels, checklists, or comments).
4. Prep handoff: assign/claim the ticket, capture acceptance criteria/tests in the description, and launch a worktree for the incoming agent.
5. Broadcast: summarise backlog moves and suggest next tasks when reporting back to the Owner.

## Launching a Task Agent

- Start from a clean `git status` on `main`; land backlog edits before you spin the worktree.
- Use the unified agent helper to create the worktree and run Codex:

  ```bash
  .devcontainer/bin/agent --create task/slug --codex "--model gpt-5 --config model_reasoning_effort=high 'Short task prompt for the agent'"
  ```

  Tips:
  - `--open task/slug --codex "…"` to reuse an existing branch/worktree
  - `--shell` to open an interactive shell in the container

- Ensure ticket updates are saved in VibeKanban before launch so the branch inherits the correct context.
- After launch, manage sessions/containers via the same helper; see `-h` for options.

## Notes to Future You

- Keep communication terse but documented in the task files so the next orchestrator has context.
- Prefer small, incremental backlog edits over sweeping reorganisations unless the Owner signs off on broader changes.
- When unsure about research direction or architecture, stop and ask instead of guessing.
