# Probing Viterbo's Conjecture – Overview

This is the high-level outline of the project. The project is a work in progress, with fast development cycle. We always target and support the latest commit for documentation, and consider older commits instantly deprecated. Breaking changes are not announced, there is no stable API whatsoever. We focus on rapid prototyping and exploration of ideas.

The project is the MSc thesis in mathematics of Jörn Stöhler, supervised by Prof. Kai Cieliebak at the University of Augsburg. The thesis aims to explore Viterbo's conjecture in symplectic geometry using computational methods.

The project consists of several components:
- Computational Prespective: A computational library for symplectic geometry, focused on calculating the systolic ratio of convex polytopes in 4 dimensions. It reproduces previous algorithms, previous results, and extends them with a new algorithm developed by us. The library is implemented in three layers: a mathematical writeup in the thesis, a Lean4 formalization of the central theorems and algorithms, a Rust implementation for high-performance pipelines with many polytopes, and a Python interface that exposes the mathematical functionality to data scientists and researchers.
- Data Science Perspective: A pipeline graph of experiments that try a large variety of conventional approaches in data science on the problem of understanding when Viterbo's conjecture holds or fails. We use the computational library as an abstraction here, i.e. treat it as a black box that produces data which we can analyze. We use the Python ecosystem for rapid prototyping.
- Mathematical Perspective: An extensive interpretation of the results of the data science experiments, porting insights back into their mathematical context. We aim to state new formal conjectures, gain confidence on them via soft predictions, or prove them using formal methods (including natural language proofs, Lean4 formalized proofs, or computational proofs that result in a verifiable certificate).

We provide the components as a single repository, together with meta-documentation about how the thesis was developed. The guiding principles are
- Complete and Explicit Records: Every aspect of the project is included in the git repository, we minimize external implicit knowledge.
- Reproducible Results: Every result can be reproduced from the writeup and code in the repository. 
- Fast-Moving Project-Internal Development Cycle: We don't offer any stable API, the latest commit is documenting only itself and not legacy commits, and breaking changes have no communication overhead.
- AI Agents: We foremost write code, documentation, and project management files with the help of AI agents. They are first-class developers, in addition to the project owner Jörn. This reinforces Completeness, Fast Development, and Reproducibility practices, since agents have full access to the repository knowledge. We design tools, APIs, and code with AI agents as developers, maintainers, and readers in mind. AI agents are ephemeral and always get onboarded to the latest commit, they usually need no knowledge about legacy commits.
- Published: The project has no external contributors whatsoever, but we make the thesis project publicly available should anyone want to build upon it or reuse parts of it.

The roadmap of the project is as follows:
- 2025-10-01: Start of work on the thesis project.
- 2025-10-10: Switch from an initial feasability prototype to the current repository.
- 2025-11-24: [In-Progress] Detailed writeups exist for the project overview, project roadmap, mathematical background, our custom algorithm. The computational library exists in Lean4, Rust, and Python with all functionality, good tests / verification, and in-code documentation. The library closely corresponds to the detailed writeups, in particular the different algorithm representations (text, Lean4, Rust; maturin Python wrapper of Rust) match up. There is a test and production pipeline in Python that generates a large dataset of polytopes and their systolic ratios. There is a result writeup that discusses other examples of polytopes $K$ with $\text{sys}(K) > 1$ that we found through random sampling and enumeration of different polytope families.
- 2025-11-30: [Planned] 
  - Experiment: Per-polytope visualization of the geometry and minimum action generalized closed characteristic, using a stereographic projection into $\mathbb{R}^3$ and static & interactive $3D$ visualization in javascript (bundled into the docs via astro).
  - Experiment: A larger dataset with more samples and more identified cases of $\text{sys}(K) > 1$ polytopes.
  - Experiment: Basic data science tools thrown at the large production dataset, including clustering and dimensionality reduction and PCAs, in order to see if there are any obvious patterns.
  - Experiment: Reducing the dataset by formalizing a metric on the space of convex polytopes up to symplectomorphisms, mainly up to affine symplectomorphisms. Since volume, capacity, and systolic ratio are invariant, we can thus distinguish in-equivalent polytope cases better, e.g. for clustering or dimensionality reduction.
  - Experiment: See how well ML methods can predict the systolic ratio of a single polytope from a mix of different geometric representations (e.g. half-spaces, vertices, $h_K(u)$ grid, ...) and under different architectures; find an architecture that's good enough, or conclude that ML methods do not learn the systolic ratio well, e.g. bc it is highly sequential to compute and our training signal is too weak to overcome the inductive bias.
  - Experiment: Computationally check that no simplex has $\text{sys}(K) > \frac{3}{4}$, which was shown by Heim-Kisliv in her master's thesis without massive computational support. Consider whether we can reproduce the result by covering the space of simplices with a finite set of upper bound estimates. Consider whether we can scale this approach to e.g. polytopes with $6$ half-spaces instead of the simplex' $5$.
  - Experiment: Computationally check that the Mahler Conjecture holds in $2$ dimensions, i.e. $\text{sys}(K \times K^\circ) \leq 1$ for all convex point-symmetric bodies $K \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. We already know that the conjecture has been proven in $2$ dimensions, so this serves as another validation of our computational pipeline.
  - Library: Implement the existing algorithms from the literature, despite being not fully specified in their papers, and less performant. In particular implement the Heim-Kisliv 2019 algorithm that uses linear programming, the Chadez Hutching 2021 algorithm that we built upon, and the Minkowski billiard algorithm from Heim-Kisliv 2024 for the special case of lagrangian products.
  - Experiment: Benchmark our algorithm implementation in Rust, profile and note hotspots, ablate certain optimizations and record their impact. Note not just CPU time, but also instrument the search behavior e.g. number of explored nodes, best-candidate found over time, pruning frequency over time, ...
  - Experiment: Harden our algorithms against numerical rounding errors. The
