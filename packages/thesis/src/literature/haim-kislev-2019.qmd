# Haim–Kislev 2019

## Context
- Source: `packages/thesis/build/arxiv/1712.03494v3/EHZ-polytopes.tex` (TeX from arXiv v3). Avoid the PDF; copy formulas from TeX.
- Goal: characterise action minimizers on convex polytopes to make c_EHZ computation combinatorial.

## Claims Checked
- Existence of a minimum-action closed characteristic whose velocity is piecewise constant and uses each facet at most once (Theorem 1.1 in paper, label `simple_loop_theorem`).
- Resulting bound: at most $\kappa_F$ velocity changes (one per facet), so the search space is finite.
- Subadditivity for hyperplane cuts follows from the combinatorial formula (Theorem `subadditivity_theorem`).

## Key Equations / Source TeX
Source TeX (Theorem `simple_loop_theorem`, lines ~130ff):
```
\begin{theorem}
... there exists a closed characteristic \gamma with minimal action ...
\dg(t)=w_i \text{ on } (\tau_{i-1},\tau_i),\quad w_i=C_i J n_{k(i)},\ C_i>0,
\text{and each facet normal } n_j \text{ appears in at most one segment.}
\end{theorem}
```
Interpretation: minimal-action trajectories visit each facet interior at most once; velocities are positive multiples of the outward facet normals rotated by $J$.

Source TeX (subadditivity, lines ~150ff):
```
\begin{theorem}
\label{subadditivity_theorem}
... K_1=K\cap H^+, K_2=K\cap H^- \implies
c_{EHZ}(K) \le c_{EHZ}(K_1)+c_{EHZ}(K_2).
\end{theorem}
```

## Caveats / Scope
- The “one visit per facet” statement can fail for minimizers passing through Lagrangian faces; the paper gives simplex counterexamples. Our algorithms must keep a fallback path for Lagrangian 2-faces.
- Results are stated for convex polytopes in $\R^{2n}$; we specialize to $n=2$.

## How We Reuse
- Search pruning: bound branching by “facet at most once.”
- Initial candidate generation: restrict to piecewise-constant velocities along $J n_i$.
- Subadditivity check: hyperplane-cut decomposition tests can use the stated inequality to bound capacities of sub-polytopes.
