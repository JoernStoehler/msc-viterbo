# Rudolf 2022 – Minkowski Billiard

## Context
- Source: `packages/thesis/build/arxiv/2203.01718v1/The_Minkowski_billiard-characterization_of_the_EHZ-capacity_of_convex_Lagrangian_products.tex` (arXiv v1 TeX).
- Goal: generalize Artstein–Avidan & Ostrover’s smooth result to all convex bodies, enabling polytope algorithms.

## Claims Checked
- Main equivalence for convex bodies $K, T \subset \mathbb{R}^n$:
  $ c_{EHZ}(K\times T)=\min_{q\in F_{n+1}^{cp}(K)} \ell_T(q)=\min_{p\in F_{n+1}^{cp}(T)} \ell_K(p)=\min_{q\in M_{n+1}(K,T)} \ell_T(q)$.
- No smoothness or strict convexity required; statement covers polytopes.
- The minimal closed characteristic on $K\times T$ corresponds to a shortest $T$-Minkowski billiard trajectory in $K$.

## Key Equations / Source TeX
Source TeX (lines near title block):
```
c_{EHZ}(K\times T) = \min_{q\in F_{n+1}^{cp}(K)}\ell_T(q) = \min_{p\in F_{n+1}^{cp}(T)}\ell_K(p) = \min_{q \in M_{n+1}(K,T)} \ell_T(q).
```
Operationally: compute minimal $T$-length over closed $(K,T)$-billiard trajectories; for polytopes, restrict to combinatorial candidates.

## Caveats / Scope
- Uses Minkowski billiard length $\ell_T$; we need an implementation for polytopes. Our current Rust/Python stacks must mirror their length convention.
- Equality holds for all convex bodies; numerical robustness still depends on how billiard paths are enumerated.

## How We Reuse
- Alternative algorithm for Lagrangian products (pentagon × rotated pentagon, etc.).
- Cross-check for our primary polytope algorithm on product instances.
- Provides lower/upper bounds by plugging candidate billiard trajectories from data or heuristics.
