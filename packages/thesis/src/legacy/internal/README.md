# Drafts (2025-11-25)

Purpose: parking lot for WIP writeups before promoting polished versions into `packages/thesis/src/`.

Current status
- Drafts from 2025-11-25 were promoted to `packages/thesis/src/01-*`, `packages/thesis/src/02-*`, `packages/thesis/src/03-*`, and `packages/thesis/src/04-*`.
- Use this folder for new WIP only; mark assistant additions with `<proposed>` and unresolved items with `TODO`.

Notes
- Treat everything here as work-in-progress; none of the claims are trusted until cross-checked against the arXiv sources in `/workspaces/worktrees/shared/arxiv-store/`.
- Prefer TeX sources over PDFs when verifying math; PDFs corrupt subtle symbols when copy/pasted.
- When a statement is uncertain, mark it `TODO:` or `(?)`.
