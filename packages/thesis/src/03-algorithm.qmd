# Algorithm Design (placeholder)

To be written. Expected content:
- problem statement the algorithm solves;
- high-level design, assumptions, and inputs/outputs;
- key correctness ideas and where proofs live;
- plan for benchmarks and validation.

Replace this placeholder with real text once the design is settled.
