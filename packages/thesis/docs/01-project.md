# Project Overview (placeholder)

This chapter is empty and must be written. It should eventually explain:
- the thesis scope and research question;
- the overall approach (symplectic background → algorithm → experiments → conclusions);
- how the chapters fit together and what the reader should expect.

Use the legacy drafts in `packages/thesis/archive/legacy/` only as raw material, then replace this file with a coherent narrative.
