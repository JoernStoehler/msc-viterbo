# Standard Counterexample

This chapter will compile the fully explicit counterexample to the weak Viterbo conjecture (Haim‑Kislev–Ostrover 2024) together with any additional worked polytopes. Content to be added:

- Facet data (normals, heights, velocities) and simple minimizing orbit in the 
  \((q_1,q_2,p_1,p_2)\), \(J(q,p)=(-p,q)\) conventions.
- Cross‑checks of signs and action with the HK/CH combinatorial formula.
- Optional second example emphasizing a non‑Lagrangian 2‑face.
- Figures and references back to the Math Background chapter.

_Write this chapter once the data and derivations are finalized._
