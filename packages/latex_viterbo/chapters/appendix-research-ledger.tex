% Research Ledger Appendix
% Reader-facing historical record of research directions explored.
% Agent tracking now lives in experiments.md and the experiment-workflow skill.

\section*{Purpose}

This appendix documents the evolution of research questions explored during this thesis.
It provides transparency about what was investigated, what succeeded, and what was abandoned.

\section{Completed Research}

(None yet.)

\section{Planned Research}

\subsection{Billiard Algorithm on HK--O Counterexample}
\label{ledger:billiard-hko-orbit}

\textbf{Research question:} Can we use the billiard algorithm to compute the systolic ratio for the HK--O 2024 counterexample and visualize a minimum-action orbit?

\textbf{Approach:} Apply the billiard algorithm from~\cite{HK2024} to compute $\cEHZ(K)$. Plot one minimum-action orbit by projecting onto either factor of the Lagrangian product $P_5 \times_L R(90^\circ) P_5$.

\textbf{Status:} Ideation.

\section{Abandoned Research}

% Document research directions that were explored but did not yield useful results.
% This saves future researchers time and provides transparency.
