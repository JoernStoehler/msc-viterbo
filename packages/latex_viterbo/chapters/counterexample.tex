This chapter will compile the fully explicit counterexample to the weak Viterbo conjecture (Haim--Kislev--Ostrover 2024) together with any additional worked polytopes. Planned content:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Facet data (normals, heights, velocities) and the simple minimizing orbit in the \((q_1,q_2,p_1,p_2)\), \(\Jmat(q,p)=(-p,q)\) conventions.
  \item Cross-checks of signs and action with the HK/CH combinatorial formula of \todocref{thm-hk-combinatorial}.
  \item Optional second example emphasizing a non-Lagrangian 2-face.
  \item Figures and references back to \cref{chap:math}.
\end{itemize}
Write this chapter once the data and derivations are finalized.
