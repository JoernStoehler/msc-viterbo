This chapter will describe the algorithmic pipeline for computing \(\cEHZ\) on admissible polytopes.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Problem statement and inputs/outputs.
  \item High-level design, assumptions, and data structures.
  \item Correctness arguments and where the proofs live.
  \item Plan for benchmarks and validation.
\end{itemize}
Replace this scaffold once the design is settled.
