The goal of this thesis is to probe Viterbo's conjecture for convex polytopes in \(\R^4\) by computational means. The conjecture was recently falsified by Haim--Kislev and Ostrover; we aim to map the landscape of further counterexamples, understand which combinatorial features force or forbid violations, and develop algorithms that make these investigations routine.

This draft migrates the MkDocs notes into the LaTeX pipeline. Content status by chapter:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \cref{chap:math} fixes notation and recalls the symplectic and convex-geometry background we rely on.
  \item \cref{chap:counterexample} will house the explicit HK\&O counterexample and other worked polytopes.
  \item \cref{chap:algorithm} outlines the planned algorithmic pipeline for enumerating and certifying closed characteristics.
  \item \cref{chap:experiments} will summarize datasets, protocols, and numerical results once available.
  \item \cref{chap:conjectures} will collect conjectures, evidence, and partial results.
  \item Appendices document supporting software (Lean, Rust), expanded experiments, AI-agent usage, and literature digests.
\end{itemize}

The writing style targets interested symplectic geometers, is explicit and skimmable, and keeps proofs and asides clearly marked. As more material is ready, the placeholders will be replaced with full text.
