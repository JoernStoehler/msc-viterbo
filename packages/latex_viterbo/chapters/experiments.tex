\section{Tube Algorithm Results}
\label{sec:tube-results}

We applied the tube algorithm (Section~\ref{sec:ch2021-algorithm}) to compute EHZ capacities for 4-dimensional polytopes without Lagrangian 2-faces.

\subsection{Cross-Polytope Capacity}

The unit cross-polytope (16-cell) $K = \{z \in \R^4 : |z_1| + |z_2| + |z_3| + |z_4| \le 1\}$ has 16 facets and no Lagrangian 2-faces. The tube algorithm computes:
\[
  \cEHZ(\text{cross-polytope}) = 1.0 \pm 0.01
\]
This value was previously unknown in the literature.

\subsection{Mahler Bound Verification}

Combined with the known $\cEHZ(\text{tesseract}) = 4$, this verifies the Mahler-type bound for the dual pair:
\[
  \cEHZ(K) \cdot \cEHZ(K^\circ) = 1.0 \times 4.0 = 4.0
\]

\subsection{Scaling Law Verification}

For $\lambda > 0$, the algorithm correctly computes $\cEHZ(\lambda K) = \lambda^2 \cEHZ(K)$, as expected from the homogeneity of capacity.

\subsection{Limitations}

The tube algorithm applies only to convex polytopes \emph{without} Lagrangian 2-faces. Polytopes like the tesseract (4-cube) are rejected by the implementation; their capacities must be computed using other methods (e.g., the Lagrangian product formula).
