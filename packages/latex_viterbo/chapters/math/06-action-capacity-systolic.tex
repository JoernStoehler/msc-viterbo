\section{Action, EHZ capacity, and systolic ratio}
For a curve \(\gamma\) in \(\R^4\), the action is
\[
  A(\gamma) = \int_\gamma \lambda = \int_0^T \lambdaform_{\gamma(t)}(\dot\gamma(t))\,dt = \tfrac12 \int_0^T \inner{J\gamma(t)}{\dot\gamma(t)}\, dt.
\]
It is invariant under orientation-preserving reparametrization and changes sign if orientation is reversed.

For bodies with enough regularity there is a closed characteristic minimizing the action; the minimum equals the Ekeland--Hofer--Zehnder capacity
\[
  \cEHZ(K) = \min\{A(\gamma) : \gamma \text{ closed characteristic on } \partial K\}.
\]
By continuity of symplectic capacities in the Hausdorff metric this definition extends to polytopes using generalized closed characteristics.

The systolic ratio is
\[
  \sys(K) = \frac{\cEHZ(K)^2}{2\, \vol(K)}.
\]
It is scale and translation invariant; for balls and cylinders of radius \(r\), \(\sys(B(r)) = \sys(Z(r)) = 1\).
