\section{Forward use}
This chapter fixes conventions and the variational/combinatorial tools used later. \cref{chap:counterexample} will work out the HK2024 counterexample and other explicit polytopes using these conventions. Algorithms and Lean formalizations will cite the facet dynamics, duality, and the HK/CH formula established here.
