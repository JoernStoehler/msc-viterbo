# Talks (archival PDFs)

This folder stores **final talk PDFs** that are useful to keep in `main`, even after
the talk sources/assets have been deleted.

Policy
1. Freeze the talk as presented by creating an annotated git tag, e.g.:
   - `talk-clarke-duality-YYYY-MM-DD`
2. Copy the final PDF into this folder (ideally the PDF contains the git commit/tag).
3. After migrating the good content into the thesis, delete the talk's standalone
   package from `main` to avoid long-lived clutter.
4. To reproduce the original talk sources/assets, check out the frozen git tag.
