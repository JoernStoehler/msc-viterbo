# AGENTS (latex_viterbo)
- Purpose: LaTeX thesis, source of truth that the other packages are based on.
- Outputs: PDF primary, HTML via latexml
- See `agent_docs/` for more details, depending on the task at hand.

## Build and Serve
Scripts
- Lint: `scripts/lint.sh` (chktex + draft compile + latexml sanity)
- Build: `scripts/build.sh [--production] [--pdf-only] [--html-only]` (single-shot; draft -> build/, production -> dist/)
- Serve: `scripts/serve.sh [--production] [--watch] [--pdf-only] [--html-only]` (rebuilds on change; can skip HTML or PDF for faster preview)
Notes
- Use `includeonly.tex` (copy from includeonly.tex.example) for faster draft cycles.

## LaTeX Style
- Follow arXiv-friendly best practices; keep packages standard.
- Math: `\(...\)` inline, `\[...\]` display; avoid `$` to dodge shell escaping issues.
- Proofs in `proof` environment; label theorems/lemmas consistently.

## Thesis Writing Style
Audience & goals
- Interested mathematicians (symplectic background); thesis is self-contained.
- Aim for mathematical precision, motivated explanations, clear structure, consistent notation.
Conventions
- Separate mainline text from asides; keep proofs clearly marked.
- Introduce notation once; note deviations from literature.
- Be explicit but skimmable: spoilers up front, headings guide the reader.
- For WIP text needing review, mark clearly (e.g., \edit{} or %).

## Assets
- Generated by Python stages; store under `packages/latex_viterbo/assets/`.
- LaTeX only includes assets; Python takes care of layout, style, regeneration.
