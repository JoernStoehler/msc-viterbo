Status of the archived rust_viterbo crate implementation.

This document tracks what was verified in the old implementation. May be useful for understanding past issues.

## CRITICAL DEPENDENCY: optim crate ⏳

The `optim` crate (`packages/rust_viterbo/optim/`) is a **STUB** that needs implementation.

**What's blocked on it:**
- `hk2019.rs::solve_qp_for_permutation` - currently uses incomplete vertex+edge enumeration
- Tests pass "by luck" because test case optima happen to be at vertices/edges

**Implementation plan:** See `optim/SPEC.md`

**DO NOT** waste time trying to fix the HK2019 QP solver without first implementing the optim crate.

## Debug Audit Summary (2026-01-20)

This section documents where the mathematical writeups, implementations, and tests have issues.

### 1. HK2019 Algorithm ❌ INCOMPLETE

| Category | Issue | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Math writeup** | Formula correct: Q(σ,β) = Σ_{j<i} β_{σ(i)} β_{σ(j)} ω(n_{σ(i)}, n_{σ(j)}) | ✅ OK |
| **Math writeup** | c_EHZ = (1/2) × [max Q]^{-1} — correct | ✅ OK |
| **Implementation** | `compute_q` — correctly implements formula | ✅ OK |
| **Implementation** | `solve_qp_for_permutation` — vertex + edge enumeration | ❌ INCOMPLETE |
| **Implementation** | For tesseract: Q=0.125 found correctly | ⚠️ Works by luck |
| **Test** | `tesseract_qp_solver_finds_optimal` — passes | ⚠️ Happens to pass |
| **Test** | `billiard_hk2019_agreement` — <0.1% relative error | ⚠️ Empirical only |

**Problem Analysis (2026-01-20):**

The HK2017 paper gives TWO equivalent formulations:

**Formulation 1 (Theorem 1):**
- Maximize Q(σ,β) subject to β ≥ 0, Σβ_i h_i = 1, Σβ_i n_i = 0
- Q is INDEFINITE quadratic, constraints are LINEAR
- This is indefinite QP over a polytope

**Formulation 2 (Remark 1.4):**
- Minimize (Σβ_i h_i)² subject to β ≥ 0, Σβ_i n_i = 0, Q(β) = 1
- Objective is CONVEX, but Q=1 is QUADRATIC EQUALITY constraint
- This is QCQP (Quadratically Constrained QP)

**BOTH formulations are NON-CONVEX:**
1. F1: indefinite objective → non-convex
2. F2: quadratic equality Q=1 → non-convex (hyperboloid constraint)

**Why the current implementation is wrong:**

The vertex + edge enumeration only checks 0D (vertices) and 1D (edges) faces. For a 3D feasible region (tesseract), the optimum could be on a **2D face** - which we don't check.

The tests pass because the optima for test cases happen to be at vertices or edges. This is **luck**, not correctness.

**To fix properly:** Need a global optimization solver. See `optim/SPEC.md` for the implementation plan. **DO NOT** attempt to fix the QP solver without first implementing the optim crate.

### 2. Billiard (LP) Algorithm

| Category | Issue | Severity |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Math writeup** | Epigraph LP reformulation — rigorous, textbook technique | ✅ OK |
| **Math writeup** | Rudolf 2022 theorems correctly cited (3-bounce bound) | ✅ OK |
| **Implementation** | LP formulation correct, uses minilp | ✅ OK |
| **Implementation** | Capacity computation verified: tesseract=4, triangle×triangle=1.5 | ✅ OK |
| **Implementation** | **Witness segment_times are zeros** (placeholder) | ⚠️ Incomplete |
| **Implementation** | Index convention (LP edge vs polygon facet) — **documented but tricky** | ⚠️ Fragile |
| **Test gap** | `billiard_witness_closes` is **ignored** (witness doesn't close) | ⚠️ Acknowledged |
| **Test gap** | `billiard_witness_positive_segment_times` is **ignored** | ⚠️ Acknowledged |
| **Test gap** | No test that validates witness satisfies differential inclusion | ❌ Missing |

**Root cause for witness issues**: The billiard trajectory gives correct T-length but doesn't directly map to Reeb orbit dynamics. Converting to a Reeb witness requires solving flow equations (see spec Section 5.1). Previous formulas were bogus (335% error) and removed.

### 3. Tube Algorithm

| Category | Issue | Severity |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Math writeup** | Flow map formula t(p) = h_k(h_j - ⟨n_j,p⟩)/(2ω(n_k,n_j)) — correct | ✅ OK |
| **Math writeup** | Rotation additivity in Sp̃(2) — correct | ✅ OK |
| **Math writeup** | Trivialization τ_F — verified in unit tests | ✅ OK |
| **Implementation** | `compute_flow_map` — appears correct | ⚠️ Unverified E2E |
| **Implementation** | `reconstruct_4d_from_2d` — uses barycentric coords, may have edge cases | ⚠️ Fragile |
| **Implementation** | `solve_closed_tube` — skips empty polygon check in closure mode | ⚠️ Risky |
| **Test gap** | No end-to-end test with known capacity result | ❌ Missing |
| **Test gap** | No test comparing tube algorithm to billiard/HK2019 | ❌ Missing |

**Investigation (2026-01-20)**: Tested tube algorithm on multiple polytopes:
- Tesseract: NoValidOrbits (Lagrangian product, as expected)
- Generic polytope (tesseract+1 facet): NoValidOrbits (rotations 1.25, 1.50)
- Cross-polytope (16-cell): NoValidOrbits (rotations ~1.8)
- 24-cell: NoValidOrbits (rotations 0.5-0.7)

All closure candidates have rotation ≠ 1.0. This suggests either:
1. These polytopes don't have short periodic orbits of the required type
2. The rotation accumulation may have an error
3. The CH2021 paper uses specially constructed polytopes

**Status**: Algorithm runs but finding a polytope with valid orbits requires more investigation.

### 4. Cross-Algorithm Agreement ✅ IMPROVED

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Billiard vs HK2019 on tesseract | ✅ Both=4.0 | HK2019 QP fixed |
| Billiard vs HK2019 on random products | ✅ <1% error | 3 proptests passing |
| Billiard vs HK2019 on triangle×triangle | ⚠️ Slow | HK2019 with 6!=720 perms takes ~0.1s |
| Tube vs Billiard on tesseract | ❌ N/A | Tube returns NoValidOrbits (Lagrangian degeneracy) |
| All three on non-Lagrangian polytope | ❌ Missing | Need non-Lagrangian polytope with known capacity |

### 5. Specification Gaps

| Spec | Gap | Impact |
|------|-----|--------|
| algorithm-hk2019-spec.md | No analytical solution for QP | Must implement numerical QP |
| algorithm-billiard-spec.md | Witness construction incomplete (§8.5) | Documented limitation |
| tube-geometry-spec.md | "Prove claims in Section 4" TODO | Claims used without proof |
| algorithm-spec.md | No explicit complexity analysis | Performance unclear |

## CRITICAL: HK2019 QP Solver (hk2019.rs) ❌ INCOMPLETE

The HK2019 algorithm requires solving a **non-convex optimization problem** (see Section 1 above).

**History:**
- Grid search: replaced with vertex enumeration
- Vertex enumeration: passes tests but is mathematically incomplete

**Why vertex enumeration is incomplete:**

The claim "for quadratic maximization over a polytope, the optimum is at a vertex" is **FALSE** for indefinite quadratics. The maximum can be at vertices, edges, 2D faces, or higher-dimensional faces.

The current code only checks vertices (0D) and edges (1D). For the tesseract (3D feasible region), the optimum could be on a 2D face.

| Function | Issue | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `solve_qp_for_permutation` | Vertex + edge enumeration | ❌ Incomplete |
| `compute_q` | Verified against known optimal | ✅ Tested |
| `enumerate_subsets` | Enumerates BFS vertices | ✅ Works |

**Tests pass by luck**, not correctness:
- `tesseract_optimal_q_value`: Q=0.125 ✓ (optimum happens to be at a vertex)
- `billiard_hk2019_agreement`: <1% error (doesn't prove correctness)

**To fix:** Need QCQP solver or global optimizer (SCIP, Gurobi, etc.)

---

## CRITICAL: Witness Segment Times (billiard.rs)

The `construct_2bounce_witness` and `construct_3bounce_witness` functions have **placeholder zeros** for segment_times.

| Function | Issue | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `construct_2bounce_witness` | segment_times = zeros (NOT IMPLEMENTED) | ✅ Documented |
| `construct_3bounce_witness` | segment_times = zeros (NOT IMPLEMENTED) | ✅ Documented |

**Note**: The capacity returned by the LP is CORRECT. Only the witness times are missing.

**Decision (2026-01-19)**: Previous bogus formulas (335% error, no derivation) removed. Now placeholder zeros with clear TODOs.

---

## HIGH: Polygon Operations (billiard.rs) ✅

| Function | Invariant | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| `from_hrep` | Vertices satisfy constraints | ✅ 3 tests |
| `support` | Returns max over vertices | ✅ 3 tests |
| `supporting_vertex` | Returns correct argmax | ✅ 2 tests |
| `polar` | Correct dual construction | ✅ 3 tests |
| `width_euclidean` | Correct width formula | ✅ 2 tests |

**Tests**: 17

**Removed (2026-01-20)**: The following functions and tests were deleted because `find_minimal_billiard` used a WRONG algorithm (vertex-search only, misses edge-interior optima):
- `find_minimal_billiard` — only checked vertices, but Minkowski billiard optima can be at edge interiors (e.g., triangle×triangle at t=1/3)
- `minimal_billiard_length` — wrapper for the wrong function
- `find_facet_for_vertex`, `find_facet_containing_point`, `find_supporting_vertex`, `find_supporting_facet` — helper functions only used by the deleted functions
- All tests for these functions

The CORRECT algorithm is in `billiard_lp.rs` which uses LP to search over continuous t∈[0,1] parameters along edges.

## Remaining Critical Work

1. **HK2019 QP Solver**: Replace with proper library or fix the bug
2. **Witness Segment Times**: Document clearly or implement correctly
3. **Integration Tests**: Add tests verifying literature values match
