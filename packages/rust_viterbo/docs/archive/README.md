# Archived Documentation

These documents have been superseded or consolidated into the main documentation.

## Why Archived

- **test-spec.md**: Overlapped with test-propositions.md and test-improvement-plan.md. Content consolidated into `../test-documentation.md`.

- **test-improvement-plan.md**: Working notes from a specific session. Key action items have been executed or recorded in `../code-audit-tracker.md`.

- **billiard-correctness-proof.md**: Mathematical derivations that are still valid but were working notes. Key claims now live in `../mathematical-claims.md`. The LP correctness proof in Section 9 remains valuable for reference.

## If You Need This Content

These files are preserved for reference. If you need content from them:
1. Check if the claim is in `../mathematical-claims.md` first
2. Check `../test-documentation.md` for test-related content
3. If not found, the archived file may have useful derivations
