# Documentation Archive Map

What moved
- `docs/archive/current/` — previous docs from this repo (roadmap, backlog, planning drafts, pm-knowledge-transfer, meta-cognition, thesis overview draft).
- `docs/archive/rust-proto/` — docs only from old repo joernstoehler/rust-viterbo (rev 999e000, copied 2025-11-25).
- `docs/archive/msc-proto/` — docs only from old repo joernstoehler/msc-math-viterbo (rev 4904c5f, copied 2025-11-25).

What stays current
- `AGENTS.md` (root) and `packages/*/AGENTS.md`.
- Root `README.md`.
- `packages/agentctl/docs/` (agent references; Gemini file still marked TODO but retained).

Notes
- Legacy trees are read-only for reference/search; they may be outdated or wrong.
- No code was imported from prototypes—only docs.
- If you need a legacy page promoted back into main docs, copy and revise it instead of editing in-place under `archive/`.
