# Thesis Writing Style

**Audience**: Symplectic geometers (MSc level).

**Goals**: Self-contained, skimmable, spoilers up front.

## Project-Specific Conventions

- State main results before proofs
- Define notation when first used; note deviations from literature
- Use `\begin{proof}...\end{proof}`, label equations for cross-reference
- Roadmap long proofs with "Proof strategy" paragraph
