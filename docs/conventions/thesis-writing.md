# Thesis Writing Style

Guidelines for writing thesis chapters for symplectic geometer audience.

## Audience and Goals

- **Audience**: Symplectic geometers
- **Self-contained**: Expose assumptions, define notation
- **Skimmable**: Headings and structure guide reader

## Exposition Structure

- **Spoilers up front**: State main results before proofs
- **Mainline vs asides**: Keep main argument clear, use remarks/footnotes for tangents
- **Progressive refinement**: Start intuitive, add rigor incrementally
- **Explicit signposting**: "First we show X. Then we use X to prove Y."

## Notation

- **Introduce once**: Define notation when first used
- **Note deviations**: Call out when notation differs from literature
- **Consistency**: Don't switch notation mid-chapter

## Proofs

- **Use proof environment**: `\begin{proof}...\end{proof}`
- **Label key steps**: Equations referenced later need `\label{}`
- **Roadmap for long proofs**: Add "Proof strategy" paragraph or outline steps

## Common Issues

**Passive voice overuse:**
- Bad: "It was shown that..."
- Good: "We show that..." or "Theorem 3.2 states that..."

**Undefined notation:**
- Check that every symbol is defined before use
- Exception: Standard notation (ℝ, ℤ, etc.)

**Missing citations:**
- Every non-obvious statement needs a citation or proof
- Standard results can cite textbooks
