# Thesis Writing Style

## Audience

- **Thesis readers:** MSc math students who took a symplectic geometry lecture
- **Code developers:** Claude agents with broad knowledge of symplectic geometry, optimization, algorithms
- **Project owner:** Jörn, up to speed with thesis references

This is a closed project (no external contributors). Papers in `docs/papers/` should be read as needed for specific tasks, not all at once.

## Goals

Self-contained, skimmable, spoilers up front.

## Project-Specific Conventions

- State main results before proofs
- Define notation when first used; note deviations from literature
- Use `\begin{proof}...\end{proof}`, label equations for cross-reference
- Roadmap long proofs with "Proof strategy" paragraph
