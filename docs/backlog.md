# Backlog (optional queue)
Working list of “ready” tasks before they become GitHub issues. Keep tidy; delete if it goes stale.

| Title | Type | Size | Owner | Depends on | Notes |
|-------|------|------|-------|------------|-------|
| Write tolerances policy (eps, perturb rules, offset bounds) | task | S | Jörn | A1 | Source of truth for numerics used by Rust/Lean |
| Baseline polytopes + expected sys/capacity values | task | S | Jörn | A1 | Simplex, cube, crosspolytope, HK2024, others |
| Sampler defaults + rejection thresholds | task | S | Jörn | A1 | Offset range, #halfspaces ranges, near-lagrangian cutoff |
| Lean axiom list (named, cited) | task | S | Jörn | A1 | What we assume vs prove; link to sources |
| Label + issue templates setup | task | S | Jörn | none | Labels: epic/task/bug/docs/lean/rust/python/experiment/thesis/infra/prio |
| Roadmap sync with overview.mdx | task | S | Jörn | A2 | Ensure overview text matches roadmap table |

Usage:
- Keep items here only if well-scoped; promote to GitHub issues when ready, then remove.
- If upkeep lags, delete this file and rely solely on issues.
