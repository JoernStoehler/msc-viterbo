# Review 08 — Review Process and Reviews in General (Second Pass)

Provenance
- Topic: 08 — Review process and reviews in general
- Author: Codex CLI Agent
- Date: 2025-10-20
- Commit: 96e7f5a
- Timebox: ~60–90 minutes
- Scope: Repository review process; minor cross-links
- Version: v0.1

Context
- Second pass focused on whether reviews are consistent, comparable, and practically usable by downstream work; goal is to reduce variance and make outputs action-ready without over-automation.

Inputs & Method
- Read `docs/reviews/README.md`, `mkdocs.yml`, skills (`skills/good-code-loop.md`, `skills/testing-and-ci.md`, `skills/vibekanban.md`).
- Commands: `uv run python scripts/load_skills_metadata.py --quiet`, `uv run mkdocs build --strict`, targeted `rg` across repo for "review", "mkdocs", and skills references.

Findings (unsorted)
- The repo has a clear index for reviews at `docs/reviews/README.md:1`, with numbering, scope, and guidance to create `docs/reviews/XX-<stub>.md`. This is a solid anchor but it lacks an explicit template file to clone; authors may diverge in formatting and sections.
- The instruction “long, unfiltered, unsorted list; redundancy OK” is explicit in `docs/reviews/README.md:6` and in task prompts, which encourages breadth. However, comparability across reviews would benefit from a semi-structured preamble (context, timebox, inputs consulted, commands run) while keeping the body unsorted.
- Current process asks each review to stand alone and links from the index. There is no required “Findings → Actions” mapping or an acceptance gate for when a review is considered done (e.g., linked ticket(s) created). This risks drift between review insights and implementation.
- MkDocs navigation lists the Reviews index only (`mkdocs.yml:21`). Individual reviews build and are discoverable by search but aren’t in the nav tree. This is acceptable if the index reliably links to all reviews; the index currently lists published topics and an upcoming placeholder for Topic 8, which we replace here.
- The `skills` system provides strong meta-infrastructure for consistent execution (e.g., `skills/good-code-loop.md:Review Checklist`, `skills/testing-and-ci.md` incremental selection). None of the skills directly define a “review methodology” cookbook (inputs, commands, evidence capture, acceptance checks) beyond the general Good Code Loop.
- There is no shared “review-run log” snippet capturing environment specifics (commit SHA, branch/worktree, `just ci`/`mkdocs --strict` statuses). Without this, reproducibility of a review’s conditions is weaker; downstream agents may expend time re-validating context.
- Acceptance criteria for reviews are implied but not codified. The prompt often says “be thorough, unsorted list, redundancy OK, ensure mkdocs build --strict passes.” Missing: explicit checks for cross-linking, nav integrity, and artifact placement where applicable.
- The index instructs “Cross-link: add a single bullet link here after saving the file,” which fosters discoverability. It does not require back-references (e.g., “See also Topics 1, 3”) which would help consolidation.
- Sequencing: The task frames 14 review topics and suggests running them independently. There is no documented recommended order-of-operations beyond topic numbering. A suggested cadence (1 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6/7 → 9/10 → 11/12 → 13 → 8 → 14) could improve dependency clarity; specifically, Topic 8 (process) benefits from being at least second, after Topic 1 (design principles), as done here.
- Consolidation plan is not formalized. There is no dedicated `docs/reviews/CONSOLIDATION.md` or tracked issue list aggregating cross-topic actions. As a result, review outputs may remain informational without feeding the planning system.
- The repo enforces `mkdocs build --strict` in local flows (`Justfile:220,289`) and recommends running it before handoff. This is a good quality gate; the review template should explicitly require authors to record the command and result.
- There is no “review rubric” to score aspects (clarity, actionability, coverage, evidence). Without minimal scoring, it’s hard to compare review quality or to quickly triage which reviews need follow-up.
- Evidence capture is inconsistent: some reviews include references to specific files and policies; others may not. Adding a small “Evidence & Pointers” footer with canonical file references (paths:line) would boost reusability.
- The repository’s “Always-On Essentials” in AGENTS.md emphasize safety and commands but not a canonical “Review Runbook.” Codifying a short, repeatable checklist would reduce variance across agents.
- The Topic 1 review sets a good tone with actionable observations and concrete suggestions. However, it mixes broad program-level recommendations with specific implementation tasks; future reviews could tag items with scope (repo/docs/code/CI/research) to speed routing.
- There is no explicit retention/removal policy for review docs—e.g., should obsolete reviews be archived or updated? Consider an “Archive” subfolder with a deprecation note when superseded.
- Review authorship and date are not standardized in headers. Adding a header block with `Topic`, `Author`, `Date`, `Commit`, `Timebox`, `Scope` would improve provenance.
- The reviews do not define a standard “Next Actions” section. Even if the main body is unsorted, a concluding summary with extracted actions would speed planning without constraining the main list.
- There is no “Conflicts/Tradeoffs” field to record when recommendations collide with existing constraints (e.g., advisor preferences, CI runtime budgets). Capturing this reduces churn.
- Reviews do not capture “What I did not review” disclaimers. This risks false confidence; a small “Out-of-scope or Not Reviewed” note rounds out completeness claims.
- The current process does not specify how to handle sensitive content found during reviews (emails, PDFs). The repo has policies under `mail/` and skills, but the review template could include a reminder to paraphrase and store summaries appropriately.
- Cross-topic references are ad hoc. A convention like “Refs: T01, T03” would support consolidation queries.
- The reviews index lists topics 1–14, which is helpful. It might benefit from a short one-liner per topic describing the objective and the primary acceptance question.
- The repo has “briefs/” and “reviews/” with different intentions. Add a one-line differentiator in the index (“Briefs propose plans; Reviews capture observations”).
- The index suggests numbering but does not constrain naming beyond `XX-stub.md`. Add a guideline: use nouns/verbs consistently (“project-design-principles”, “review-process”) for predictability.
- There is no guideline for maximum time spent per review vs depth expectations. A soft timebox plus a “defer to follow-up” mechanism may improve throughput.
- Recommend a short “Checklist: Before Submit” in README and the template.
- Recommend reviewers include the exact commands run (e.g., `rg` searches) and the most relevant outputs (≤10 lines each).
- Introduce optional severity/risk tags in-line to aid triage without forcing structure.
- Require a short “Intended Consumers” note when the audience matters (owner, agents, advisor).
- Provide a template block for “Sequencing & Dependencies” when helpful.
- Define simple success criteria for the review process itself (coverage of topics; cycle time from review to actions).
- Encourage reviewers to validate that new review docs don’t break links or nav (`uv run mkdocs build --strict`).
- Ensure accessibility: prefer single-idea bullets; avoid dense paragraphs.
- Encourage file references with `path:line` notation for precision.
- Propose adding a “Known Limitations of This Review” section in each writeup.
- Consider adding a “Version” field to support iterative refinement.

Actions (first pass)
- Add `docs/reviews/TEMPLATE.md` and require its use for new reviews.
- Update `docs/reviews/README.md` with a concise pre-submit checklist and pointer to the template.
- Update existing reviews to follow the template shape (provenance, sections, validation notes).

Cross-References
- docs/reviews/README.md
- mkdocs.yml
- skills/good-code-loop.md
- skills/testing-and-ci.md
- skills/vibekanban.md

Validation
- Loaded skills metadata: `uv run python scripts/load_skills_metadata.py --quiet` — OK
- Built docs strictly: `uv run mkdocs build --strict` — OK

Limitations
- Did not run full `just ci`; changes are docs-only.
- Findings emphasize process and documentation; not a content review of math or algorithms.

Status
- Finalized
